Due to a large file size of initial data, I have packed it into a pickle file for optimising storage space. If CSV file isn't accessable, you can either download it [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes). Or un-comment a cell in `Main.ipynb` file responsible for fetching data from `DataFramed.pkl`.
